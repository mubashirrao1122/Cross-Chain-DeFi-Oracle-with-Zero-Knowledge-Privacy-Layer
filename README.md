# Cross-Chain DeFi Oracle with Zero-Knowledge Privacy Layer



## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for a next-generation blockchain infrastructure solution that addresses four critical challenges in the current blockchain ecosystem:

1. Oracle reliability
2. Cross-chain interoperability
3. Transaction privacy
4. Scalability

By combining zero-knowledge cryptography with cross-chain communication protocols and oracle mechanisms, this project creates a secure, private, and efficient foundation for next-generation decentralized applications.
