# Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the Cross-Chain DeFi Oracle with Zero-Knowledge Privacy Layer project documentation.

## Blockchain Fundamentals

### Blockchain
A distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions across multiple computers to ensure security, transparency, and decentralization.

### Smart Contract
Self-executing code that runs on a blockchain and automatically enforces the terms of an agreement when predetermined conditions are met.

### Consensus Mechanism
A protocol that enables distributed systems to agree on a single version of the truth, commonly implemented as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).

### Gas
A unit of computational work required to execute operations on the Ethereum blockchain, with each operation requiring a specific amount of gas.

### Block
A collection of transactions grouped together, cryptographically secured, and linked to the previous block, forming a chain.

## Oracle System

### Oracle
A system that connects blockchains with external, real-world data sources, enabling smart contracts to access off-chain information.

### Data Source
An external provider of information, such as price feeds, weather data, or sports results, that oracles bring onto the blockchain.

### Oracle Attack
A manipulation of oracle data inputs to exploit dependent smart contracts, potentially leading to financial losses.

### Validator
A participant in the oracle network responsible for fetching, verifying, and submitting external data to the blockchain.

### Aggregation
The process of combining multiple data points from different sources to derive a single, more reliable value.

### Reputation System
A mechanism that tracks the historical performance and reliability of oracle validators to incentivize honest behavior.

## Cross-Chain Technology

### Cross-Chain
The capability to interact, communicate, or transfer
